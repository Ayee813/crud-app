CRUD App â€“ Vue.js + Express
This is my first CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project.
The backend is built with Express.js, and the frontend uses Vue.js.

ðŸ§ª Features
Add, edit, and delete products

Simple interface

Note: After adding or editing a product, please refresh the page to see the updated result.

ðŸš€ How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayee813/crud-app.git
cd crud-app

2. Start the Backend

bash
cd backend
npx nodemon index.js

3. Start the Frontend
bash
cd ../frontend
npm install   # (only the first time)
npm run dev
4. Open the app in your browser:

ðŸ’¡ Notes
If changes donâ€™t show immediately after adding or editing, refresh the page manually.

Make sure ports for backend and frontend donâ€™t conflict.
